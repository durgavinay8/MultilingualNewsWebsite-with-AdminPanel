# MultilingualNewsWebsite-with-AdminPanel

Developed a multilingual news website, enabling seamless management of articles in the database and integration of CRUD operations, user requests, and translation tasks. Admins efficiently oversee article assignments while translators access a dedicated frontend panel for the visibility of assigned articles. Real-time communication between admins and translators is facilitated through web sockets. Translators initiate the translation process, utilizing the googletrans API
for automated translation.
